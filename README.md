A landing page of a fictitious sportswear / shoe brand called Jumpit that I've created using Bootstrap. It is my first and biggest scaled Bootstrap project. Link: https://lighthearted-pegasus-c41445.netlify.app/

Also the logo, shoe banners and contact section background image designs are made by me using Photoshop.
